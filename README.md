This project utilizes a supervised machine learning algorithm, specifically simple linear regression, to predict a student's score based on the number of hours they study

Overview
This repository contains the necessary code and dataset to build and train a simple linear regression model. The model is trained using the provided dataset to establish a relationship between study hours and student scores.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two columns:

Hours: Number of hours the student studied
Scores: Corresponding scores achieved by the students

Instructions
Load the dataset.
Explore the data to understand the relationship between study hours and scores.
Preprocess the data if needed (handling missing values, scaling, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the simple linear regression model.
Evaluate the model's performance.
Use the trained model to predict scores based on study hours.
